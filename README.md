# nikhef-2021-gw

This repository stores the example Jupyter notebooks used during the Nikhef GW Workshop 2021. They make use of [`PyCBC`](https://github.com/gwastro/pycbc) code and are largely based on the [PyCBC tutorials](https://github.com/gwastro/PyCBC-Tutorials). They make use of data from the [Gravitational Wave Open Science Center (GWOSC)](https://www.gw-openscience.org/).

These notebooks can be easily launched in Google Colab via the links below.

## Tutorial 1
This notebook goes through the basics of data handling, signal processing, matched filtering, and signal consistency tests with `PyCBC`.

## Tutorial 2
This notebook uses `pycbc_inference` to demonstrate gravitational wave parameter estimation. It is a slightly modified version of [PyCBC Inference Tutorial 0](https://github.com/gwastro/PyCBC-Tutorials).
